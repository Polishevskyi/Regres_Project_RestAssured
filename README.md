# Automated API Testing with Java, Maven, TestNG, Rest Assured, WebDriverManager, Allure, and Jenkins

Welcome to the GitHub repository for our automated testing project. This project provides a comprehensive solution for automating testing, focusing on web services and API endpoints. We utilize a stack of powerful technologies, including Java, Maven, TestNG, Rest Assured, WebDriverManager, Allure, and Jenkins to streamline the testing process.

## Key Technologies

- **Java:** The primary programming language for creating robust and scalable test scripts.
- **Maven:** The build and project management tool to simplify dependency management and test execution.
- **TestNG:** A versatile testing framework for structuring and running test cases with ease.
- **Rest Assured:** A popular framework for testing RESTful web services and APIs.
- **WebDriverManager:** An easy-to-use tool for managing web driver setup and configurations.
- **Allure:** A powerful reporting tool for generating detailed and visually appealing test reports.
- **Jenkins:** Integration with Jenkins for continuous integration and automated test execution.

## Prerequisites

Before getting started with this project, ensure you have the following prerequisites in place:

- **Java Development Kit (JDK):** Required to compile and run Java code.
- **Maven:** The project uses Maven for dependency management and build automation.
- **TestNG:** A testing framework for executing and managing test cases.
- **Rest Assured:** For testing RESTful web services and APIs.
- **WebDriverManager:** Used to simplify web driver management.
- **Allure:** For generating detailed and visually appealing test reports.
- **Jenkins:** If you intend to set up continuous integration.

## Getting Started
1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Configure your test environment and URLs in the appropriate configuration files.
3. Run the tests using Maven: mvn clean test
4. Generate Allure reports: allure generate allure-results --clean -o allure-report
5. View the detailed test reports in the `allure-report` directory.

## Usage
- Customize and expand the existing test suites to fit your project's requirements.
- Integrate this repository with Jenkins for automated test runs and continuous integration.
